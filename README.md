## Abstract

After traveling to Ocean City, Maryland, and trying crab for the first time, I not only gained an appreciation for the delicacy of this food but also for the fantastic creature that it is. Its unique shape and features motivated me to study specifically the rock crab Leptograpsus variegatus. By analyzing the two color forms (blue/orange), we can note a significant difference in body metrics such as carapace length that can classify the blue and orange variants as two species. Additionally, we can observe the linear relationship between carapace length (mm) and frontal lobe size, which can help us further understand the evolution of the crab. 


## Introduction

Morphological variation within a species is a crucial topic in evolutionary biology. It is important to understand what can cause differences among species which can give important information about how that species adapts to its environment. Also, understanding how other body metrics can correlate with each other is an important concept found within Leptograpsus rock crabs that helps us better understand their anatomy. The data set was conducted by NA Campbell and Rod J Mahon across the coast of Australia in 1974. It aimed to study morphological variation in the blue and orange-form variations of rock crabs of the genus Leptograpsus. 

The data set contains 175 observations and 8 variables, including body metrics and their corresponding sex and species. We will focus on the Carapace Length (mm) as our variable of interest, as it is a great measurement of the overall body size of the blue and orange crab. We will also use frontal lobe size for our correlation. 

**Research Questions**

1. Is there a significant difference in the mean carapace length between blue and orange variations of the Leptograpsus?

2. Is there a significant and strong relationship between frontal lobe size and carapace length?
